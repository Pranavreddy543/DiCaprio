# Structural Design Patterns

> Deal with **object composition** — how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

## Patterns Overview

| Pattern | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Adapter** | Make incompatible interfaces work together | Integrating legacy/third-party code |
| **Decorator** | Add behavior dynamically without subclassing | Wrapping, logging, caching |
| **Facade** | Simple interface to complex subsystem | Simplify client usage |
| **Proxy** | Control access to object | Lazy init, access control, logging |
| **Composite** | Tree structure of objects | File systems, UI hierarchies |
| **Bridge** | Decouple abstraction from implementation | Platform-independent UI |
| **Flyweight** | Share state to support many objects | Character/particle systems |
