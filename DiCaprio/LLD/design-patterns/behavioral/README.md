# Behavioral Design Patterns

> Deal with **object interaction** — how objects communicate and assign responsibilities.

## Patterns Overview

| Pattern | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Observer** | One-to-many dependency; notify on state change | Event systems, pub-sub |
| **Strategy** | Interchangeable algorithms | Payment methods, sorting |
| **State** | Object behavior changes with internal state | FSM, workflow |
| **Command** | Encapsulate request as object | Undo/redo, queues |
| **Template Method** | Skeleton algorithm, steps vary | Framework hooks |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass request along chain of handlers | Middleware, validation |
| **Iterator** | Access elements without exposing structure | Collections |
| **Visitor** | Add ops to objects without modifying them | AST, serialization |
