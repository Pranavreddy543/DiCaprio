# Design Patterns — LLD Interview Prep

> Master design patterns to crack Senior SDE / SDE2 interviews. Focus on **when to use**, **how to implement**, and **interview Q&A**.

## Quick Reference

| Category | Patterns | Interview Frequency |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Behavioral** | Observer, Strategy, State, Command, Template Method | ⭐⭐⭐ High |

## Interview Tips

1. **Don't recite definitions** — Interviewers want to see you *apply* patterns to real problems.
2. **Start with the problem** — "We need X because of Y" → then introduce the pattern.
3. **Know trade-offs** — Every pattern has pros/cons; mention them.
4. **Real-world examples** — Logger (Singleton), Payment (Strategy), Event systems (Observer).
5. **Code on whiteboard** — Practice writing clean, minimal implementations.

## How to Use This Repo

1. Read each pattern's `README.md` for concept + when to use.
2. Implement the code example from scratch (no copy-paste).
3. Solve the "Interview Questions" at the end of each pattern.
4. Revise the "Common Interview Q&A" section before interviews.
