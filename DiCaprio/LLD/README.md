## How to Approach LLD Interviews

1. **Clarify requirements** — Ask about scale, constraints, extensibility
2. **Identify entities** — Nouns → Classes; Verbs → Methods
3. **Apply patterns** — Don't force; use when they solve the problem
4. **Code cleanly** — Interfaces, single responsibility, meaningful names
5. **Discuss trade-offs** — "I used X because Y; alternative Z would..."
