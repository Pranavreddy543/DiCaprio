## DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

- **Arrays & Strings** — Two pointers, Sliding window, Prefix sum
- **Hashing, Linked List, Stack & Queue** — Common patterns
- **Trees, Graphs** — DFS, BFS, Topological sort
- **Dynamic Programming, Binary Search, Backtracking**
- [Interview Cheat Sheet](./DSA/INTERVIEW-CHEATSHEET.md) for quick revision

## LLD (Low Level Design)

- **Design Patterns** — Creational, Structural, Behavioral
- **Multi-threading** — Threads, Synchronization, Deadlock, Thread pools, Concurrent collections
- **OOP & SOLID** — Pillars, SOLID principles, Composition vs Inheritance
- [Design Patterns Cheat Sheet](./LLD/design-patterns/INTERVIEW-CHEATSHEET.md) | [Multi-threading](./LLD/multi-threading/INTERVIEW-CHEATSHEET.md) | [OOP](./LLD/oop-solid/INTERVIEW-CHEATSHEET.md)

## HLD (High Level Design)

- **Fundamentals** — Load balancing, Caching, DB scaling, Message queues, API design
- **System Designs** — URL shortener, Rate limiter, Chat, News feed, Distributed cache
- **Distributed Systems** — CAP, Consistency, Replication, Sharding, Transactions
- [Interview Cheat Sheet](./HLD/INTERVIEW-CHEATSHEET.md) for quick revision

## How to Use

1. Pick a topic (e.g., Design Patterns)
2. Read the README and pattern docs
3. Implement examples from scratch
4. Revise the cheat sheet before interviews
